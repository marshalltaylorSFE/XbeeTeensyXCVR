Library creation projects
------------

This should be the final library development branch.
Created library template.  Copy to libraries folder and remember to copy back if pushing changes.

The client currently compiles with the library, but does not do much else.

This library has two examples, one as a serial host and the other, the client.  Think of it as the client sends raw control input to the host, which is a continous being.
