Library creation projects
------------

8/15/2016:
This should be the final library development branch.
Created library template.  Copy to libraries folder and remember to copy back if pushing changes.

This library has two examples, one as a serial host and the other, the client.  Think of it as the client sends raw control input to the host, which is a continous being.
